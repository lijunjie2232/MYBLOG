# 問題

```bash
❯ git submodule add https://github.com/volantis-x/hexo-theme-volantis .\themes\volantis
fatal: A git directory for 'themes/volantis' is found locally with remote(s):
  origin        https://github.com/volantis-x/hexo-theme-volantis
If you want to reuse this local git directory instead of cloning again from
  https://github.com/volantis-x/hexo-theme-volantis
use the '--force' option. If the local git directory is not the correct repo
or you are unsure what this means choose another name with the '--name' option.
```
